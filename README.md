# CASA-Poststamp

This is a module for getting poststamps and statistics from CASA images, either manually or in an automated fashion. It makes use of CASA, matplotlib and some astropy routines

## catalog_cutouts.py

Script that wraps around the `casa_subimage.py` and `casa_stats.py` scripts in the module to create cutouts and measure statistics of sources from a catalog. If a 'Quality_flag' column is present in the catalog this is used to determine which sources are selected, sources with a quality flag of 0 will be measured. 

```
usage: catalog_cutouts.py [-h] [-s] [-t THRESHOLD] image catalog

positional arguments:
  image                 Input image.
  catalog               Input catalog

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --stats           Measure the statistics for all the sources and write
                        to the catalog
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Threshold for measuring statistics to use (in sigma,
                        default=3.0)
```

## casa_subimage.py

Make a subimage in CASA. Pass coordinates and size, in either pixel or sky coordinates. Standard output is another CASA image, but this can be converted to fits.

```
usage: casa_subimage.py [-h] [--pixel] [-x X] [-y Y] [--xsize XSIZE]
                        [--ysize YSIZE] [--fits]
                        in_image out_image

positional arguments:
  in_image       Input image, either CASA or fits format.
  out_image      Name of the output cutout image.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --pixel        If this option is selected, input should be given in pixel
                 coordinates (default=sky coordinates).
  -x X           RA/X central coordinate (default=100).
  -y Y           DEC/Y central coordinate (default=100).
  --xsize XSIZE  Size of image in RA/X (default=100).
  --ysize YSIZE  Size of image in DEC/Y (default=100).
  --fits         Store the output image as a fits file.
```

## casa_stats.py

Measure the statistics of a CASA (cutout) image and store them in a csv file. Statistics are measured at given RA and DEC above given threshold, and thus is only done for single islands of emission. Output stored in the `source_stats.csv` consists at the moment of: the intensity weighted mean RA and DEC, the integrated flux of the island, and columns indicating whether the mean RA/DEC is located within the bounds set by the threshold, and whether the maximum RA/DEC match with the input RA/DEC. A source is assigned a source ID if that is specified.

```
usage: casa_stats.py [-h] [--coord COORD [COORD ...]] [-i ID] [--plot]
                     in_image threshold

positional arguments:
  in_image              Input image.
  threshold             Perform statistics on everything above threshold
                        (Jy/beam).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --coord COORD [COORD ...]
                        Source coordinates (RA, DEC) of the source, input as
                        RA DEC (default=center of the image)
  -i ID, --id ID        Optional source id to keep track of the stats
                        (default=0)
  --plot                Plot the source along with threshold
```

## plot_image.py

In case you want to make a pretty plot of a source. Should in principle work on any fits image you give it.

```
usage: plot_image.py [-h] [--percentile PERCENTILE] [--cmap CMAP] [--dpi DPI]
                     image_file

positional arguments:
  image_file            Input image in fits format.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --percentile PERCENTILE
                        Percentile interval to use for normalization
                        (default=99.9).
  --cmap CMAP           What colormap to use (default=gist_heat)
  --dpi DPI             Dpi of the image (default=300).
```
